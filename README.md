# Z_Cipher
This Python script demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption process using a symmetric encryption technique called XOR operation.

## Aim
The aim of this Python script is to illustrate a basic encryption and decryption process using the XOR operation, showcasing the principles of symmetric encryption through a simple implementation. As Z_Cipher's algorithm heavily concentrates on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher">XOR Cipher,</a> the script serves as an educational tool for demonstrating the XOR encryption technique.

### What is XOR?
XOR stands for exclusive OR. The sample chart below illustrates this logic gate.

<table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>Output</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

#### What is XOR Cipher?
In XOR encryption, each character of the plaintext is combined with a corresponding character from the key using the XOR operation. This process creates ciphertext, which can then be decrypted by XORing it with the same key to retrieve the original plaintext. Personally, I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvII6_O6KAc">this</a> YouTube video because it simply explains how the whole algorithm works.

## To Execute the Code
